I wanted to make an app to find the closest dog park to me anywhere in the world using the google maps API so my Mom could find places for her dog to play when she travels.

Technologies: This is a simple React application using the Google Maps API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run: git clone the app then run 'npm start'.
